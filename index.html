<h1>Bob Sweeney &bull; P1</h1>
<p>Hello world! My name is Bob Sweeney! What's yours? (Strains of "Let Me Entertain You" from the musical <em>Gypsy</em> by Stephen Sondheim go through my mind).</p>

<h2>About me.</h2>
<p>I've been a graphic designer for the Harvard Division of Continuing Education for the past 15-plus years mostly working from the print side of things. Before coming to Harvard, I worked as a freelance illustrator, designer (web and print&nbsp;&mdash; or as was popular in those halcyon days: information architect) mostly working with ad agencies, media companies, corporations, and Boston University admissions. Prior to freelancing I worked as a graphic designer/illustrator for NYNEX Information Systems (remember the Yellow Pages?) creating  corporate crap, uh collateral (maps, newsletters, sales collateral, etc). Education wise, I got a BS (bull s$@#er's) degree in psychology, a BA (bad attitude) in Art, and (if I can pull off writing the damnable thesis) I'll soon have a Masters of Liberal Arts focusing on Drama that would make me a psychotic dramatic artist.</p>
<h2>Why this course?</h2>
<p>In a two words: Job Security. In one word: Marketability (in case the other two words fall through). The director of my department is all about outsourcing. First it was the print work (catalogues, brochures, magazines), print advertising was outsourced and soon to be followed by online advertising, now there's rumblings that even web design will soon follow. I'm being asked to be play more of a &#8220;supportive role&#8221; to the web developers and take up some of their &#8220;low hanging fruit.&#8221; So the NEED to know dynamic web stuff and understand web development is more imperative than ever. I've been so overwhelmed by the changes that I'm finding it hard to learn in a consistent manner on my own. The need to learn EVERYTHING NOW! has me a bit scattered and flustered that I thought a formal course that will force me to learn the stuff I've been trying to piece together would be a good thing. </p>
<h2>HTML/CSS experience</h2>
<p>Back in the stone ages of the late 1990's I used to create web pages using html, static sites with hundreds of pages and inline styling. I had gotten the job at Harvard just as CSS came onto the scene. I looked at it briefly but then was doing all the print stuff which I loved. I was able to ignore the web except for the occasional html email blast that I could still miraculously use my archaic skills. Recently, I took a html building class about (Oh God, was it really eight years ago?) working with xhtml4 and a bit of php and while I did well, I haven't touched it much since.</p>
<p>All that's a changing. About two years ago I helped convert a couple static sites to the Drupal environment (the more complex <a href="http://www.dce.harvard.edu/professional">Professional Degree Programs</a> and the simple <a href="http://hilr.dce.harvard.edu">Institute for Learning in Retirement</a>). Mostly breaking down the site into components and figuring out how to make it dynamic in Drupal but not really touching the html/css stylings or templates. There was a web designer was doing that (she just retired and I doubt she'll be replaced) and the web developers helped me out when I got stuck.</p>
<p>We (more the web developers) entered into the world of responsive sites with <a href="http://www.summer.harvard.edu">Summer School</a> using Drupal 6 with Foundation 4 underpinnings. They are currently considering Drupal 7 with Omega 4 responsiveness on <a href="http://www.extension.harvard.edu">Extension School</a>.</p>
<p>So I'm learning how to go beyond the basic html/css that I've ignored for the past decade and jumping into the lovely world of sass, Drush, and what not. Command line is new territory and I've been playing around with it enough to get myself into trouble -- especially trying to install things and get the various versions up-to-date and playing nicely with each other. I'm also working on a private site that uses Wordpress. </p>
<h2>Expectations</h2>
<p>So my hopes are that I can gain a better understanding of the underpinnings of sites using Drupal and Wordpress and fill in gaps in my addled brain.</p>
<h2>PHP and coding</h2>
<p>Way back in college I used to program in Cobol, Fortran, and Pascal though now I don't think I could tell you a if/then statement from an until. I can look at the code and be able to decipher it but honestly I'd say I'm a novice at best.</p>
<h2>Platform: Mac</h2>
<p>I'm working in a Mac environment trying different text editors (the old stand by BB Edit, Expresso, Coda, and sublime are all in the applications folder but I've yet to pick a favorite. I remember loving bbedit when I was doing webpages way back in the stone ages.</p>
<h2>Anything else?</h2>
<p>Well, now that you mention it, yes. I'm considering creating a social site that this course could do wonders for.</p>
