<h1>Bob Sweeney &bull; P1</h1>
<p>Hello world! My name is Bob Sweeney! What's yours? (Strains of "Let Me Entertain You" from the musical <em>Gypsy</em> by Stephen Sondheim go through my mind).</p>

<h2>About me.</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a graphic designer for the Harvard Division of Continuing Education for the past 15-plus years mostly working from the print side of things. Before coming to Harvard, I worked as a freelance illustrator, designer (web and print&nbsp;&mdash; or as was popular in those halcyon days: information architect) mostly working with ad agencies, media companies, corporations, and Boston University admissions. Prior to freelancing I worked as a graphic designer/illustrator for NYNEX Information Systems (remember the Yellow Pages?) creating  corporate crap, uh collateral (maps, newsletters, sales collateral, etc). Education wise, I got a BS (bull s$@#er's) degree in psychology, a BA (bad attitude) in Art, and (if I can pull off writing the damnable thesis) I'll soon have a Masters of Liberal Arts focusing on Drama that would make me a psychotic dramatic artist.</p>
<h2>Why this course?</h2>
<p>Expanding my skill set. Been on the fringe of web development working with drupal in a basic way but I would like to know more about the underpinnings. I also manage a dance group's wordpress site and want to tinker with the design and features to get it cleaner and responding faster. I've been trying to learn it piece meal on my own through online tutorials but I figured a formal course with strict deadlines will force me to learn the stuff I've been trying to piece together.</p>
<h2>HTML/CSS experience</h2>
<p>Back in the stone ages of the late 1990's I used to create web pages using html, static sites with hundreds of pages and inline styling (in some ways it's wild how it seems the issues I faced back then&nbsp;&mdash; small file sizes, fast loads, designing for small screens&nbsp;&mdash; have come back full circle for mobile. Though with css and java script it's a whole new ballgame and I'd like to learn more about where to place js calls and what not so that I create sites that are &ldquo;mobile/content first&rdquo;. I kept abreast of html/css developments but only coded or debugged as I needed to (at work we have a web designer and two web developers to do most of the grunt work). About two years ago I helped convert a couple static sites to the Drupal environment as a way to learn (the more complex was <a href="http://www.dce.harvard.edu/professional">Professional Degree Programs</a> and the simpler <a href="http://hilr.dce.harvard.edu">Institute for Learning in Retirement</a>). Mostly breaking down the site into components and figuring out how to make it dynamic in Drupal but not really touching the html/css stylings or templates. I would say in some resects I'm very familiar with html, but css (and sass) is fairly new to me and I hope to get more familiar with them as I force myself to get through these assignments.</p>
<h2>PHP and coding</h2>
<p>Way back in college I used to program in Cobol, Fortran, and Pascal though now I don't think I could tell you a if/then statement from an until. I can look at the code and be able to decipher it but honestly I'd say I'm a novice at best.</p>
<h2>Platform: Mac</h2>
<p>I'm working in a Mac environment trying different text editors (the old stand by BB Edit, Expresso, Coda, and sublime are all in the applications folder but I've yet to pick a favorite. I remember loving bbedit when I was doing webpages way back in the stone ages.</p>
<h2>Anything else?</h2>
<p>Well, now that you mention it, yes. I'm considering creating a social site that this course could do wonders for.</p>
