<p>My name is Bob Sweeney! What's yours? (strains of "Let Me Entertain You" scroll through my mind).</p>
<h2>About me</h2>

<p>I forget how I'm supposed to set this up but vaguely remember something about a blurb about me. So here goes: I've been a graphic designer for the division of continuing education for the past 15-plus years. Times be a changing and I'm being asked to help support the web developers in the group so I figured I'd bone up on my skills. We're working in Drupal with a bit of Foundation thrown in but now we're checking out Omega 4. So I'm learning how to go beyond the basic html/css that I've ignored for the past decade and jumping into the lovely world of sass, drush, and what not. I'm also working on a private site that I've taken over that works with Wordpress. So my hopes are that I can gain a better understanding of the underpinnings and fill in gaps in my addled brain.</p>
