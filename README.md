# Hello World

Trying for simplicity. Was going to go all out and make this a foundation site but an unexpected office move and setting up a new laptop has me a bit frazzled.

The <a href="http://helloworldsweeneybobusa.onjumpstarter.io">helloworldsweeneybobusa.onjumpstarter.io</a> is just a "quick" intro to who I am and if I have time I'll add more to the file such as css and a bit more snazziness.
