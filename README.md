# Hello World

Trying for simplicity. Was going to go all out and make this a foundation site but computer woes (setting up a new laptop is fun!) and an office move has me a bit frazzled.

The index.html is just a quick intro to who I am and if I have time I'll add more to the file such as css and a bit more snazziness.
